GPU-Accelerated Neural Network (NNGL)
A high-performance neural network implementation leveraging OpenGL compute shaders for GPU acceleration. This project explores the intersection of graphics programming and machine learning, demonstrating how modern GPU compute capabilities can dramatically accelerate neural network training and inference.
Overview
This project implements a fully GPU-accelerated neural network using OpenGL compute shaders. Unlike traditional CPU-based implementations or CUDA-specific solutions, this approach uses OpenGL for cross-platform GPU computing, making it accessible across different graphics hardware vendors.
Key Features

Pure GPU Implementation: All neural network operations (forward pass, backpropagation, weight updates) run on GPU
OpenGL Compute Shaders: Cross-platform GPU acceleration without vendor lock-in
Interactive Testing Interface: Real-time CLI for testing and benchmarking
Memory Efficient: Direct GPU buffer management with minimal CPU-GPU transfers
Configurable Architecture: Support for multiple layer types and activation functions

Architecture
The implementation consists of several key components:
Core Classes

NeuralNetwork: Main orchestrator handling training pipeline and GPU resource management
Layer: Individual network layer with GPU buffers for weights, biases, activations, and gradients
Shader: OpenGL compute shader wrapper for GPU kernel execution

GPU Kernels (Compute Shaders)

forward_pass.comp - Matrix multiplication and activation functions
delta_loss.comp - Output layer error calculation
backward_pass.comp - Hidden layer gradient computation
update_weights.comp - Weight parameter updates
update_biases.comp - Bias parameter updates

Training Pipeline
The GPU-accelerated training follows the standard backpropagation algorithm:

Forward Pass: Input propagation through all layers with activation
Loss Calculation: Error computation at output layer
Backward Pass: Gradient propagation through hidden layers
Parameter Update: Weight and bias updates using computed gradients

All operations are parallelized across GPU compute units, with careful memory barrier synchronization between stages.
Example Use Case
The current implementation is trained to approximate the function f(a,b) = sin(a) * sin(b), demonstrating the network's ability to learn complex non-linear relationships.
Interactive Testing
The built-in CLI provides several testing modes:
bashnn> test 1.57 3.14          # Test specific inputs
nn> random                  # Test random values
nn> batch 100              # Batch test 100 samples
nn> benchmark              # Performance benchmark
nn> layer 0                # Inspect layer details
Performance Characteristics
GPU acceleration provides significant performance improvements:

Parallel Processing: Thousands of operations executed simultaneously
High Throughput: Capable of processing thousands of inferences per second
Memory Bandwidth: Efficient utilization of GPU memory hierarchy
Scalable: Performance scales with GPU compute capability

Technical Implementation Details
Memory Management
The implementation uses OpenGL Shader Storage Buffer Objects (SSBOs) for efficient GPU memory management:

Input/target data buffers for training batches
Per-layer weight and bias parameter storage
Activation and gradient buffers for forward/backward passes
Automatic buffer sizing and overflow protection

Compute Workgroup Optimization
Workgroup dispatch is carefully calculated to maximize GPU utilization:
cppint workgroups_x = std::min((int)ceil(batch_size * input_size / 16.0f), 65535);
int workgroups_y = std::min((int)ceil(batch_size * output_size / 16.0f), 65535);
glDispatchCompute(workgroups_x, workgroups_y, 1);
Synchronization
Memory barriers ensure proper data dependencies between compute shader stages:
cppglMemoryBarrier(GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BARRIER_BIT);
